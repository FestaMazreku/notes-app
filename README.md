How to run your app with all the necessary details
Relating to the task please add answers to the following questions;

i. How might you make this app more secure?
1. Authentication and Authorization: Implement robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the app and perform actions.
2. Data Sanitization and Validation: Employ thorough data sanitization and validation techniques to prevent injection attacks and maintain data integrity.
3. Transport Layer Security (TLS): Serve the application over HTTPS to encrypt data during transmission, mitigating the risk of interception or tampering.
4. Input Validation: Implement stringent input validation measures to safeguard against malicious inputs and potential security vulnerabilities.
5. Comprehensive Error Handling: Establish robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully and prevent the exposure of sensitive information.

ii. How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?
1. Database Optimization: Utilize scalable database solutions and employ effective indexing strategies to optimize data retrieval and storage.
2. Caching Mechanisms: Implement caching mechanisms to alleviate the load on the database and enhance performance by caching frequently accessed data.
3. Horizontal Scaling: Employ horizontal scaling techniques such as load balancing and deploying the application across multiple servers to distribute incoming traffic evenly.
4. Asynchronous Processing: Implement asynchronous processing and message queuing systems to handle tasks that can be deferred, enabling efficient processing of large datasets.
5. Continuous Monitoring and Performance Tuning: Regularly monitor the application's performance metrics and resource utilization, and optimize code and infrastructure as needed to sustain scalability.
